The roads are all unpaved, but we want to distinguish between them. We will use two classifications: residential road and tertiary road. We also describe tracks below, but please do not focus time and attention on mapping tracks. 

- *Residential*. The majority of roads that you see in the imagery should be classified as "residential". These roads are easily seen but won't look particularly wide - most of them are only about one lane wide. When in doubt, classify a road as residential. These are roads between communities that are not on the roads stemming from the Saraya-Kedougou road.
- *Tertiary*. The most obvious, widest paths that you see should be classified as "tertiary roads". These roads are easily seen in the drone imagery and will seem wide enough for two cars to pass. Most of the roads that stem from the Saraya-Kedougou road are tertiary. They are laterite roads that cars can pass on. Typically only one car can fit at a time, but there is space for two cars to pass each other. 
- *Tracks*. The remaining paths that you see should be classified as "tracks", but tracks are actually not a priority for this project so please do not spend much, if any time on mapping tracks. Tracks are trails and paths that only a 4WD vehicle, a motorbike, or a pedestrian would be able to travel. They will be faint and difficult to see, they might appear and then disappear, and they may look like footpaths between houses or within a single piece of property.

These images should give a general sense of what these features look like.
